# Trello Clone Backend

This repository contains the backend implementation for a Trello clone application. The backend is built using Spring Boot and provides RESTful APIs for user authentication, project management, and task management.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: 
  - Registration with name, email, and password
  - Login functionality
  - JWT-based authentication for securing APIs

- **Dashboard**:
  - Users can view two tabs: Projects and Task Board

- **Projects**:
  - Create new projects with a name and description
  - View details of each project along with the tasks associated with it
  - Add new tasks to a project

- **Task Board**:
  - View all tasks from all projects
  - Tasks are divided into various columns based on their status (e.g., Backlog, In Discussion, In Progress, Done)

- **Tasks**:
  - Tasks have attributes such as project, name, detailed description, status, tags, due date, and assigned user
  - Proper validation for all form fields on both frontend and backend

- **Security**:
  - All APIs and pages are authenticated
  - Only the login or registration page is visible to unauthenticated users

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: For building the backend RESTful APIs
- **Spring Security**: For securing the application
- **JWT**: For token-based authentication
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for development and testing
- **JPA/Hibernate**: For database interactions
